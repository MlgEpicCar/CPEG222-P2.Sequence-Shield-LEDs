    /* Bit Manip Magic Breakdown (kinda just notes for my future self ngl)
    *  Goal: We need to edit GPIOB so that we can set our pins mode to output
    * 
    *  Step 1: Start with the onboard LEDs and their port numbers as an example we can use
    *  the blue LED whose port number is 7, in MODER since each pin gets 2 digits this means we
    *  can simply multiply the port number by 2 to get it's designated spot (14 and 15). Another
    *  way to think about it is to realize port num 0 gets digits 0 and 1, port num 1 gets 
    *  digits 2 and 3... regardless of it's port number, multiplying it by the number of digits 
    *  the value you're aiming for is will always lead to what you're looking for
    * 
    *  Step 2: We use 3U to set the value at the two important bits to 11, 3 in binary is 11 and
    *  the U means it's unsigned (not able to be negative, think abosulte value)
    * 
    *  Step 3: We use ~ to flip all of the bits, so 00000000011000000 becomes 11111110011111
    *  we do this to prepare to AND our mask with the original
    * 
    *  Step 4: We use x &= y (a short hand of x = x & y) to and our original dataset with
    *  our mask so that anything that was originally a 0 stays a 0 and anything that was
    *  a 1 stays a 1, but critically our two bits become 00 regardless of what they were before
